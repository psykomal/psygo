## About this blog

I write about :
- Software systems, internals and design
- Neuro and biological systems. I believe learning brain and body internals will help us become better brain and body users
- Lifestyle systems relating to mental health, meditation, solarpunk

### What am I doing now?
(Updated May 21st, 2023)

- 😇 Currently [resting in motion](https://mindingourway.com/rest-in-motion/).
- 🔩 Trying to get deeper and learn software internals by building them (think compiler, VM, kernel, database engine, RPi)
- 🦀 Learning and coding in Rust
- 🧠 Exploring the relation between brain, programming and software design
- 😇 Exploring meditation, mental health and reflecting/reorienting my relationship with everything
- ☘️ Other misc topics I am reading - Solarpunk, Permaculture, Systems Thinking, LLM stuff
- Thinking deeply about Nate Soare's [Minding Our Way](https://mindingourway.com/) articles and Mindful CBT


### Random Musings
- Writing `About Me` is hard. 
- Few `About Me` pages I like 
  - [Gwern's](https://www.gwern.net/Links) - Very sophisticated
  - [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) - Well structured keeping the reader in mind
  - [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/about/) - Simple and to the point
- I plan to redesign this page at some point when I understand myself better
