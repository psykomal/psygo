### Random Musings
- Writing `About Me` is hard. 
- Few `About Me` pages I like 
  - [Gwern's](https://www.gwern.net/Links) - Very sophisticated
  - [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/) - Well structured keeping the reader in mind
  - [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/about/) - Simple and to the point
- I plan to redesign this page at some point when I understand myself better
