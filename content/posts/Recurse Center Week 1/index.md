# Week 1 at Recurse Center

This is an attempt to collect all the things I've learned, worked on, and experienced during my time at RC. 


## Day 1

- Introductions and onboarding
- Met a lot of passionate, kind, and wonderful people. Everyone had exciting backgrounds and projects they were going to work on.
- As expected, there were many Rustaceans and wannabes. 
- Russell Webb's Neural Network with Rust caught my eye and I will spend some time understanding it and learning Rust and NN in the process.
- For now, I have decided to spend my first week at RC meeting people, exploring different arenas, getting started with pair programming, and going with the flow. 
- I have to also make a more concrete plan for learning Rust and diving into Databases.
- I am looking forward to attending the Rust, System Design, and DDIA study groups. 
- Overall, this was a great start and I have high hopes for the coming weeks. Let's go!

## Day 2

- Paired with Anatol Liu as a part of pair programming workshop. We created a simple cmd line mastermind game and a solver in Python. 
- A few people reached out to me from my blog which kind of made my day
- Watched Zero to Hero first video by Karpathy, which explained backpropagation clearly. His teaching is truly amazing (something to learn from)


## Day 3

- Coffee chats with few recursers. Discussed Databases, Distributed Systems, Rust, the projects they are working on and advice for me
- Started working on micrograd using Rust - https://github.com/psykomal/micrograd-rs
- At this point in time I am just focused on completing as many small projects in Rust to have the concepts sync in quickly


## Day 4

- Paired with Russ on his Neural Network project in Rust. Although some of the ML stuff went over my head, I got a view into coding with Rust
- Attended the DDIA study group and discussed Ch 3: Storage and Retrieval. There was an interesting discussion on modeling SQL on top of key-value store. I realized why study groups work better sync in the concepts in the brain
- The presentation event was amazing with some truly out-of-the-world content. The moldable dev concept was new to me. There was this out-of-the-world alien presentation to me which was truly mind-blowing - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrrU5jPUYO4


## Day 5

- Pair progrogrammed on a Columnar DB with Rust. I realized the struggle Rust puts you in, on your early days. 
- Cleared some of my confusion on Rust's smart pointers - Box, Rc, RefCell
- Reanalyzed my priorities in the volitional muscles workshop and became a bit more self-aware on my FOMO toward ML. That doesn't mean I am putting it off. It will be another tool in my toolbox and I do plan to open up the layers of abstraction some other time. For now, all focus is on Databases.
