# Week 1 at Recurse Center

This is an attempt to collect all the things I've learned, worked on, and experienced during my time at RC. 


## Day 1

- Introductions and onboarding
- Met a lot of passionate, kind and wonderful people. Everyone had exciting backgrounds and projects they are going to work on.
- As expected, there were many Rustaceans and wannabes. 
- Russell Webb's Neural Network with Rust caught my eye and I am going to spend some time understanding it and learn Rust and NN in the process.
- For now, I have decided to spend my first week at RC meeting people, exploring different arenas, get started with pair programming and go with the flow. 
- I have to also make a more concrete plan on learning Rust and diving into Databases.
- I am looking forward to attending the Rust, System Design and DDIA study groups. 
- Overall, this was a great start and I have high hopes for the coming weeks. Let's go!
