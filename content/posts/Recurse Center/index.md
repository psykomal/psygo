So I have finally been accepted to the Recurse Center Fall 2, 2023 batch. I am super excited to spend the next 6 weeks learning, collaborating and growing as an engineer. RC has been a dream for a long time and I can't wait to immerse myself in the community. Infact, this was my second attempt trying to get in. I will probably write another post reflecting on my initial rejection, lessons learned and contrasting with the second attempt. For now, I am just celebrating this milestone and looking forward to the retreat. Let the learning begin!

My major plan is to dive deep into Databases, Distributed Systems and pick up Rust. I also want to explore the low level world of Machine Learning (tinygrad, Mojo). 
- Databases
  - Watch [CMU Intro to DB videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjaKScG3l0nuOiDTTqpfnWFf)
  - Either complete the [CMU Assignments](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2023/assignments.html) in Go or work on the [pingcap talent plan TinySQL and TinyKV](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan)
- Rust
  - Read the Book 
  - Complete Rustlings
  - Pick up some interesting projects - to be figured out
- Distributed Systems
  - Continue reading DDIA
  - Discuss System Design Case Studies
- Some exploratory work in low level ML 
- Apart from this pair program a lot, meet interesting people, build my volitional muscles and have fun!
