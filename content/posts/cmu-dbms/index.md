This is a mindmap of my notes from the CMU Database Systems courses - [CMU Intro to Database Systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjaKScG3l0nuOiDTTqpfnWFf) and [15-721 Advanced Database Systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjYzlLMbX3cR0sxWnRM7CLFn). It is an ongoing effort to connect various concepts through visual relationships. Currently the mindmap is not optimized to be viewed in the browser. Until I come up with a better way or integrate a viewing tool, consider downlaoding and viewing in an image viewer.
