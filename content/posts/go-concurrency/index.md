This is a mindmap of my notes from various sources mentioned below. 
- [Golang IO Cookbook](https://jesseduffield.com/Golang-IO-Cookbook/)
- [Go Walkthrough: io](https://www.gobeyond.dev/io/)
- [Streaming IO in Go](https://medium.com/learning-the-go-programming-language/streaming-io-in-go-d93507931185)
- [Concurrency In Go - Katherine Cox-Buday](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/concurrency-in-go/9781491941294/)


It is an ongoing effort to connect various concepts through visual relationships. Currently the mindmap is not optimized to be viewed in the browser. Until I come up with a better way or integrate a viewing tool, consider downlaoding and viewing in an image viewer.
