This is not an attempt to persuade anyone to skip college and self-study Computer Science. In fact, I myself have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Pilani (Tier-1 college in India). I am writing this for a few reasons:

  

1. To make my reasons more concrete for myself

2. For anyone considering going on the same path, this might help you decide. I plan to keep updating this page along my journey.

3. Feedback and reiteration. By writing this, I am expecting criticism. I want to hear and consider it, come back, and edit this.

  
  

## Assumptions:

  

1. I am talking as someone with a Bachelor's in CS from India and around 4 yrs of industry experience
2. I consider myself a practitioner rather than a researcher and focused on improving as a practitioner
3. By masters, I mean masters in Computer Science from US, Canada or European universities. This doesn't matter much but some of the statements below make more sense in this context.
4. I do not have anything against college.

  
  

## Goals:

  

1. Become a better software engineer

2. Improve myself in the craft of programming

3. Monetary

  

## The good parts of college

  

College has given me some good things I want to start with.


1. **Friends for life** - A group of fun interesting people who I love and respect

2. **Brand value** - While this doesn't last long, I believe it helps for the initial few yrs of your life (unfortunately people are biased and [signalling](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/posts/please-not-another-bias-an-evolutionary-take-on-behavioural-economics) works)

3. **Imposed structure** and **Deadlines** - This kept me on my feet and made me study on days I didn't feel like it, keeping me **consistent**. Fear is one of the best motivators and there is nothing wrong with it.

4. **My first job** - College placements

  


## Why not college?

  

1. **I do not like imposed structure**. Every college curriculum requires the student to complete a set of courses and electives to graduate. While it has its benefits (above), I do not like working that way. I want to spend more time on OS or Databases if I am interested and less time on Compilers if I am not, or skip it till I realize [the need](/posts/why-learn-compilers).

2. **Colleges impose competition over learning**. Students are incentivized by design (both by structure and [**mimesis**](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-know-what-you-really-want-and-be-free-from-mimetic-desire)) to study for better grades and jobs. Designed properly, it might even help learn but is the stress necessary? I do not have anything against competition but I do believe being aware of where it is required and not is helpful. It misleads the unconscious to think life is a [zero-sum game](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1267179384886095873?s=20) and has implications on mental health as well.

3. **Cost** - The stress of study loans. Well, this is not a huge factor and in fact, the job that you get later usually pays well enough to repay those loans. But why would I want to pay and be miserable (above reasons) for a few years of my life when I can spend it on my own terms, learn whatever I want, and earn along the way. Note - this is an arguable point and you might think the reward (abroad job) might be well worth the sacrifice. In that case, please go ahead, my best wishes.

4. **Colleges might be a good filter for talent but the "filter is the same"**. This means the peers often are alike in more ways than less. Again this is arguable.

  
  

## Why self.masters?

  

1. **I have always been an introverted self-study person**. Even in high school, I loved buying books and self-studying. Had lots of questions, but always tried finding answers on my own rather than asking the teacher (I do not recommend this. This is a very slow learning process and I have changed now). This has improved my self-learning skills and given any topic, I know where and how to search, collect information, organize a structure that suits me, execute and learn (I abide by [spaced repetition](https://fs.blog/spacing-effect/)), go back and edit my plan and reiterate.

2. **I truly believe in self-education and homeschooling**. I also want to have some kind of impact in the field in the future, and walking this route will give me more insight. The Internet has enabled true knowledge sharing and increased the potential of anyone who wants to learn.

  

> *Free education is abundant, all over the Internet. It's the desire to learn that's scarce.*
>
> -- Naval Ravikant

3. **Freedom** - I can work on whatever piques my curiosity, on my own terms. While this is good, it also requires a level of discipline and commitment which I will talk about in the `How` section

4. **Extra time** - The time freed by not stressing over exams and unwanted courses mean free time to either have a day job or work on a side business or improve other skills you lack, write a blog, focus on health, etc. Replace **zero-sum** with **positive-sum** games. Also actually focus on learning than focusing on exams. 

  

## How?

Let's unbundle the abstraction that is college.

> College = Knowledge + Structure + Motivation + People + Job + Brand + Office Hours

A college implicitly offers all these things but there are tradeoffs in this implicit nature. Can we do better?


## Strategies

### **Knowledge** and **Structure**

The internet is an amazing resource for information. We have access to online courses and materials from some of the best institutes and teachers in the world. 

We wanted to escape the imposed **structure** before, but some sort of structure or plan is often necessary for the pursuit of any kind. But now we get to create our structure taking the good parts from the tons of structures available online (some mentioned in strategies below)

1. [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) is a wonderful resource to get started
	1. The authors of teachyourselfcs run an instructor-led program called [Computer Science Intensive](https://bradfieldcs.com/csi/). While it is still a paid program, the curriculum is ideal for anyone willing to be a better practitioner. It can be taken as an inspiration to create our own! (Do check out their interesting example projects)
2. Few other notable mentions
	1. [A self-learning computer science curriculum](https://onestepcode.com/computer-science-curriculum/)
	2. [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
	3. [A Self-Learning, Modern Computer Science Curriculum](https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/)


### **Motivation** 

The deadlines and tests certainly help create the force to learn and maintain consistency. Fear often is a wonderful motivator. However, we can hack motivation and put systems in place to maintain consistent habits. 

1. Motivation is [weird](https://youtu.be/axrywDP9Ii0). The link explains why at the start of any pursuit, we are extremely motivated (dopamine is not about getting the reward, but the anticipation of it) but it slowly wanes off. No matter how interesting something is, we cannot love it all the time, and maintaining consistency requires discipline from our front.
2. One strategy I use is a sort of a game that uses money and fear as a motivator (I borrowed this idea from a friend). I lend my girlfriend (this can be anyone you trust) some collateral amount which is big enough to make me feel the pain if I lose it and if I don't complete some task(the final result should be something tangible) by a set deadline, she can spend it on anything. I have explicitly told her not to sympathize with me. And the end result should be something tangible (like a course certificate, a blog post summarising my learnings, or a project on Github). Set deadlines considering your other commitments. To date, she has never got the chance :)
	1. An interesting crypto project I think about is - If task verification can be coded, a smart contract can be written to do this


### **People** 

This is one of the best things a college gives you. However, there are better ways to meet interesting people.

1. Attend meetups, hackathons, and conferences (both offline and online - both have their own pros/cons)
2. You can meet some really interesting people online - tech twitter (maybe mastodon now, haha), reddit, discord, slack
3. Attend a cohort or retreat
	1. I attended [the lambda retreat](https://anandology.com/lambda-retreat/) recently hosted by [Anand](https://anandology.com/). Met some amazing tech people with diverse backgrounds who opened my perspectives and knowledge in entirely new ways
	2. Recurse Center is another retreat that deserves its own section (check below)
4. Join a Study group to learn some hard topic together


### **Job** and **Brand**

1. College gives a brand value which also helps in a job. Other than that, what matters is your own preparation (leetcode) and knowledge
3. Brand is an ok signal about your capability, but how can we signal capability more explicitly without it
	1. Project Portfolio and OSS contributions
	2. Tech Talks
	3. Strong technical blog
	4. Checkout [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)
	5. Creating content to help people learn has a three-fold benefit for you
		1. Will help you get better
		2. Will improve your brand image
		3. Can also make you money
4. Having a [strong network](#people) also helps in job search



### **Office Hours**

1. Office hours are certainly a valuable time for clearing doubts and building relationships with professors. 
2. Can be replaced by posting a question in specific channels on Reddit, discord, or slack. There are passionate people willing to help everywhere online
	1. I recently posted a question on Reddit about why should one learn compilers and have got amazing [answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Compilers/comments/101b6kb/why_should_i_learn_compilers/)
3. Or just ChatGPT
