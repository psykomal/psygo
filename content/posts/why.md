Why am I doing this ?

- [**Signalling**](https://www.jasoncollins.blog/posts/please-not-another-bias-an-evolutionary-take-on-behavioural-economics)
    
    Not signalling is signalling as well, you might as well manage it consciously

- **Accountability**

    Doing things in the open means an extra BS filter + feedback (do reach out for that). I will be more accountable for my information which further pushes me to understand and research more.

- **To Learn**

- **Help Share Knowledge**

- **I like writing and want to improve** - to ideate, explore, and design information structure

    I often look at my older writings and wonder with awe, was I the one who had written that. Sometimes I end up learning something new from my past writings. Something very similar happens with programmers looking at their own code written years or even months back.

    Blogs are like a torch in [the dark forest](https://g.co/kgs/JEa3sY). A search for one's own tribe. Do reach out if you find anything interesting and wanna talk.
